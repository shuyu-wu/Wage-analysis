#Python Mini Project

Given that some individuals come to Flatiron School with a diverse set of strengths and weaknesses, the following mini-project can be used to assess the strengths and weaknesses of students that do not feel challenged enough in the first week. The output of this mini-project can be used to modify the Mod 1 project goals. 

#Project

Research Question: 
> What factors best predict an individualâ€™s wage using the `Wage` dataset? For this project, please use a small, documented Jupyter notebook that includes the following:

Access details about the variables [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/ISLR/man/Wage.html)

* Brief introduction/summary/abstract that declares the scope of the project
	- Situate the goals of the analysis
	- Provide the main take home points for the non-technical reader. 
* Documentation of any data cleaning that needs to be performed on the data analysis.
-	Address missing values
-	Address distributions of variables
-	Provide summary tables of key variables of interest
* Visualize variables needed for regression modeling
	-Use matplotlib or to make presentation ready data visualizations of each variable to be used in the regression model. 
	-Plots should not have default library settings.
* Run a regression model with Wage as the target variable/DV using statsmodels.api
* Interpret the output of the model in a small paragraph
	- Include R^2 values
	- Interpretation of standardized and unstandardized coefficients
* Write two lists	
	- List of tasks you found easy
	- List of tasks you found difficult 
* Send the repository you used to complete manage the project to your lead instructor. 

Time to Complete: 24 Hours
